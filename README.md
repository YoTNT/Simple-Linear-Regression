# Simple-Linear-Regression
This is a small project to implement simple linear regression by using Python and R.

## Description
1. Preprocessing the raw data and sepearting them into the **Training Set** and the **Test Set**
2. Using Linear Regression to fit the Training Set and finding out the linear relationship
3. Trying to predict the dependency by the Test Set and comparing the results with the Test Set.
